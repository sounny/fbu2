Final Project outline

Target User: People interested in public health/Measles outbreak

Motivation: How help people understand and identify vulnerable populations and areas with low immunization coverage. To keep the public informed and help bring awareness to the importance of the measles vaccine.

Goals:

#1 Identify states with consistently low MMR vaccination rates

#2 Detect sharp changes in coverage over time that may indicate policy failures or misinformation spread

#3 Map out outbreaks per state

Objectives & Operands:

#1 Explore spatial patterns in MMR coverage by location (county/state)

#2 Filter vaccination data by year range or threshold by years 2013â€“2024, % coverage

#3 Compare trends (Vaccine and outbreak rates) across states using line charts

Key Insights:

#1 Identify which states dropped below the herd immunity threshold

#2 See if there are any outbreaks with drops in vaccination rates
